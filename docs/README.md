# Noms User Guide

Noms is a hungry little task monster that helps you record, find, schedule,
complete, and remove tasks. Your tasks are saved automatically, so they will
still be on the menu the next time you open Noms.

## Quick start

1. Install Java 25 if it is not already installed.
2. Download `noms.jar` and place it in a folder of your choice.
3. Open a terminal in that folder and run:

   ```text
   java -jar noms.jar
   ```

4. Type a command in the text box at the bottom of the Noms window.
5. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or select **Send**.
6. Type `bye` when you are finished.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enter dates as `yyyy-mm-dd`, including leading zeroes. For example, enter
> 6 September 2026 as `2026-09-06`.

## Command summary

| Action | Command format |
| --- | --- |
| Add a todo | `todo <description>` |
| Add a deadline | `deadline <description> /by yyyy-mm-dd` |
| Add an event | `event <description> /from yyyy-mm-dd /to yyyy-mm-dd` |
| Show every task | `list` |
| Mark a task as done | `mark <task number>` |
| Mark a task as not done | `unmark <task number>` |
| Delete a task | `delete <task number>` |
| Find tasks by description | `find <keyword>` |
| Show tasks on a date | `on yyyy-mm-dd` |
| Change a deadline date | `snooze <task number> /by yyyy-mm-dd` |
| Change an event's start date | `snooze <task number> /from yyyy-mm-dd` |
| Change both event dates | `snooze <task number> /from yyyy-mm-dd /to yyyy-mm-dd` |
| Exit Noms | `bye` |

Words in angle brackets, such as `<description>`, are placeholders. Replace
them with your own value and do not type the angle brackets.

Noms accepts leading and trailing whitespace, as well as repeated spaces or
tabs around `/by`, `/from`, and `/to`. Whitespace within a task description is
kept as part of the description. The `list` and `bye` commands do not accept
arguments.

## Adding tasks

Noms supports three kinds of tasks:

- **Todo** (`[T]`): a task without a date.
- **Deadline** (`[D]`): a task that must be completed by one date.
- **Event** (`[E]`): a task that takes place over a range of dates.

### Adding a todo

Use `todo <description>` for a task without a date.

```text
todo borrow a library book
```

### Adding a deadline

Use `deadline <description> /by yyyy-mm-dd` for a task with a due date.

```text
deadline submit report /by 2026-09-20
```

### Adding an event

Use `event <description> /from yyyy-mm-dd /to yyyy-mm-dd` for an activity
with a start and end date. The end date must be later than the start date;
same-day and backwards date ranges are rejected.

```text
event project retreat /from 2026-10-03 /to 2026-10-05
```

New tasks are added to the end of the task list and saved automatically. Noms
rejects a task if another task has exactly the same type, description, and
date or date range. Completion status is ignored when checking for duplicates,
so marking an existing task as done does not allow an identical copy to be
added.

## Viewing tasks

### Listing every task

Use `list` to display all tasks and their task numbers.

```text
list
```

The symbols beside each task show its type and status. `[ ]` means the task is
not done, while `[X]` means it is done. For example:

```text
1.[T][ ] borrow a library book
2.[D][X] submit report (by: Sep 20 2026)
```

> [!TIP]
> Run `list` before using a command that needs a task number. Only the task
> numbers shown by `list` should be used with `mark`, `unmark`, `delete`, and
> `snooze`. Numbers shown by `find` and `on` refer only to those filtered
> results. Deleting a task renumbers the tasks after it.

### Viewing tasks on a date

Use `on yyyy-mm-dd` to show deadlines due on that date and events taking place
on that date. An event is included on its start date, end date, and every date
in between. Todos are not included because they have no date.

```text
on 2026-10-04
```

## Finding tasks

Use `find <keyword>` to search task descriptions. The search is
case-insensitive, accepts more than one word, and includes partial matches.

```text
find project
find SUBMIT REPORT
```

The numbers in search results number the matches themselves, not their
positions in the complete task list.

## Updating task status

Use the task number shown by `list` to mark a task as done:

```text
mark 2
```

The task's status changes from `[ ]` to `[X]`. To put it back on the menu,
use:

```text
unmark 2
```

These commands work with todos, deadlines, and events.

## Snoozing dated tasks

Use `snooze` to reschedule a deadline or event. Snoozing keeps the task's
description, completion status, and position in the list unchanged.

To replace a deadline's due date:

```text
snooze 2 /by 2026-09-27
```

To move an event to a new start date while keeping its original duration:

```text
snooze 3 /from 2026-10-10
```

To replace both an event's start and end dates:

```text
snooze 3 /from 2026-10-10 /to 2026-10-12
```

When both event dates are replaced, the new end date must be later than the
new start date.

Todos cannot be snoozed because they do not have dates.

## Deleting tasks

Use `delete <task number>` to remove a task permanently.

```text
delete 1
```

Noms shows the removed task and the number of tasks remaining. The remaining
tasks are then renumbered.

## Exiting Noms

Use `bye` to close Noms safely.

```text
bye
```

All changes to the task list are saved as they are made. Noms loads the saved
list automatically the next time it starts. The tasks are stored in
`data/noms.txt`, relative to the folder from which you launched Noms.

If Noms cannot save a change, it reports the error and does not apply that
change. The previous save file is preserved.

## Troubleshooting

- If Noms rejects a date, check that it is a real calendar date in
  `yyyy-mm-dd` format, such as `2026-02-28`.
- If Noms reports that a task number is out of range, run `list` and use a
  number currently shown there.
- If a command is not understood, compare it with the formats in the
  [command summary](#command-summary). Keep `/by`, `/from`, and `/to` in the
  positions shown.
- If Noms reports a spoiled save-file entry, that entry was malformed or
  duplicated and has been skipped. Other valid entries are still loaded.
  Invalid entries include records with missing or extra fields, invalid
  completion flags or dates, and empty descriptions. Avoid editing
  `data/noms.txt` manually.
- If Noms cannot load or save the menu, check that `data/noms.txt` and its
  containing `data` folder are accessible and writable. A failed change is not
  applied, and the previous save file remains intact.
